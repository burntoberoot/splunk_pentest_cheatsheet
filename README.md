# Splunk pentest cheatsheet


## Internal structure

Splunk has it's own structure that is simmilar to linux, where app root is `$SPLUNK_HOME` - (default is `/opt/splunk`)

- `bin/`
	- `scripts/`
		- scripts that will be executed after specific allert is triggered
- `etc/`
	- `passwd` -  file with logins and hashes of splunk users 
	- `apps/` - directory conains all installed app
		- `<some_app>/`
			- `appserver/`
				- `static/`
				- `controllers/`
					- `<some_script_0.py>` - you can trigger this script via web by going to `http://example.com/en-EU/custom/<app_name>/<endpoint_name>`.
			- `default/`
				- `data/` 
				- `app.conf` - genereal info about app - name, description, checksum
				- `web.conf` - file that contains list of `endpoints`. Every endpoint is a script in `../appserver/controllers` without extension, i.e. `<some_script_0>` 
			- `local/`
				- `/local`
					- `savedsearches.conf` - list of alerts assosiacted with a current app. Every alert described as what action will be made for corresponding condition
			- `metadata/`
				- `default.meta` -
				- `local.meta` - alerts' creation time and their owners
			- `static/`
	- `users/`
- `share/`
- `var/`
- `openssl/`

## SPL - Search Processing Language 

SPL is a very powerfull feature of Splunk. 
By creating your custon requests you can extract some interesting data.

### Usefull SPL requests

- `| metasearch index=* | chart count over source by index` - get all indexes
- `| chart count by source | sort count desc` - get indexes and sources
- `| search index=<index name>` - get content of an index
- `| inputcsv 123.csv` - get the value of $SPLUNK_HOME
- `| rest service/server/info` - just another way to communicate with rest api

## Vulnerabilities

### RCE methods

- In runtime
	- Upload your custom app via built-in functionality ([Check this guide by Kevin Dick](https://threat.tevora.com/penetration-testing-with-splunk-leveraging-splunk-admin-credentials-to-own-the-enterprise/))
- Required splunk restart
	- via custom Alerts
	- via custom Controller
		- upload shell file to a controller folder - `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<some_app>/appserver/controllers/<some_shell_script.py>`
		- upload file (rewrite) with your custom endpoint to a - `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<some_app>/default/web.conf`


### Misc

#### Check your capabilities and other info

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/authentication/users/<yourusername>`

#### Way to enumerate users (Authenticated)

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/<username>/user-prefs/data/user-prefs/general`

#### Access  a .conf configuration file:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/configs/conf-<file>`

#### List all system and app configuration files:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/properties`

#### Access monitor inputs:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/data/inputs/monitor/`

#### List all indexes:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/data/indexes`

#### Get Splunk instance information:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/server/info`

#### Access server configuration information for a Splunk platform instance:

- `https://<host>/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/server/settings`
